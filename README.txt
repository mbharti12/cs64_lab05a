The secret formula file is encrypting and decrypting a given array of integers, which has cryptographic applications.
It takes in a set of integers and encrypts them with the secret_formula_apply function and then decrypts those encrypted numbers with the secret_formula_remove function.
The decrypted array is equivalent to the array whose elements were inputted into the secret_formula_apply function. At the very end, the values are outputted.
